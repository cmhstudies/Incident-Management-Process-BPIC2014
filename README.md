# Logistic Regression of Incident Data to Identify Predictors of SLA Breaches

This repository contains the notebooks, data, and reports prepared for the completion of my capstone project in pursuit of a Master of Science degree in Data Analytics from Western Governors University. 

# Abstract

Information Technology (IT) Service Management practices optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of IT services delivered to users. Incidents represent service disruptions. Service Level Agreements (SLA) establish thresholds for resolution of incidents within specified timeframes based on impact and urgency designations. Decreasing SLA breaches increases the availability of IT services and represents an important consideration for IT service providers. 

This study explores indicators of incident SLA breaches with respect to data available during the early stages of an IT incidentâ€™s lifecycle. The study built a Logistic Regression model using Python and a number of tools from the SciKit-Learn library. Some supplementary analysis leveraged the R language. 

The Task 2 Data Analytics Report describes the data collection, the data extraction and preparation, and the analysis steps performed throughout the study followed by a summary of findings, implications, and recommendations.
